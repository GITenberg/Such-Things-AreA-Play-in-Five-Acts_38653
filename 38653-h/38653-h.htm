<h3><span class="wide">ADVERTISEMENT.</span></h3>

<p>The travels of an Englishman throughout
Europe, and even in some parts of Asia,
to soften the sorrows of the Prisoner, excited
in the mind of the Author the subject of
the following pages, which, formed into a
dramatic story, have produced from the
Theatre a profit far exceeding the usual
pecuniary advantages arising from a successful
Comedy.</p>

<p>The uncertainty in what part of the East
the hero of the present piece was (at the
time it was written) dispensing his benevolence,
caused the Writer, after many researches
and objections, to fix the scene on
the island of Sumatra, where the English
settlement, the system of government, and
every description of the manners of the people,
reconcile the incidents of the Play to
the strictest degree of probability.</p>

<br />
<i>Enter Sir</i> Luke, <i>followed by Lady</i> Tremor.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> I tell you, Madam, you are two and thirty.</p>

<p><i>Lady Tremor.</i> I tell you, Sir, you are mistaken.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Why, did not you come over from
England exactly sixteen years ago?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Not so long.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Have not we been married the tenth
of next April sixteen years?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Not so long.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Did you not come over the year of
the great Eclipse? answer me that.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> I don't remember it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> But I do&mdash;and shall remember it as
long as I live&mdash;the first time I saw you, was in
the garden of the Dutch Envoy; you were looking
through a glass at the sun&mdash;I immediately began
to make love to you, and the whole affair was
settled while the eclipse lasted&mdash;just one hour,
eleven minutes, and three seconds.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> But what is all this to my age?</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Because I know you were at that
time near seventeen&mdash;and without one qualification
except your youth&mdash;and not being a Mullatto.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Sir Luke, Sir Luke, this is not to be
borne&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Oh! yes&mdash;I forgot&mdash;you had two
letters of recommendation, from two great families
in England.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Letters of recommendation!</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Yes; your character<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>that, you
know, is all the fortune we poor Englishmen, situated
in India, expect with a wife who crosses the
sea at the hazard of her life, to make us happy.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> And what but our characters would you
have us bring? Do you suppose any lady ever
came to India, who brought along with her,
friends, or fortune?</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> No, my dear&mdash;and what is worse&mdash;she
seldom leaves them behind, either.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> No matter, Sir Luke&mdash;but if I delivered
to you a good character<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Yes, my dear you did&mdash;and if you
were to ask me for it again, I can't say I could
give it you.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> How uncivil! how unlike are your
manners to the manners of my Lord Flint.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Ay&mdash;you are never so happy as when
you have an opportunity of expressing your admiration
of him&mdash;a disagreeable, nay, a very
dangerous man&mdash;one is never sure of one's self in
his presence&mdash;he carries every thing he hears to
the ministers of our suspicious Sultan&mdash;and I feel
my head shake whenever I am in his company.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> How different does his Lordship appear
to me&mdash;to me he is all <i>politesse</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> <i>Politesse!</i> how shou'd you <ins title="original has underderstand">understand</ins>
what is real <i>politesse</i>? You know your
education was very much confined.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> And if it <i>was</i> confined<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I beg, Sir
Luke, you will one time or other cease these reflections&mdash;you
know they are what I can't bear!
[<i>walks about in a passion.</i>] pray, does not his Lordship
continually assure me, I might be taken for
a Countess, were it not for a certain little groveling
toss I have caught with my head&mdash;and a certain
little confined hitch in my walk? both which I
learnt of <i>you</i>&mdash;learnt by looking so much at <i>you</i>.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> And now if you don't take care, by
looking so much at his Lordship, you may catch
some of his defects.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> I know of very few he has.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> I know of many&mdash;besides those he
assumes.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Assumes!!<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Yes; do you suppose he is as forgetful
as he pretends to be? no, no&mdash;but because he
is a favourite with the Sultan, and all our great
men at court, he thinks it genteel or convenient
to have no memory&mdash;and yet I'll answer for it,
he has one of the best in the universe.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> I don't believe your charge.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Why, though he forgets his appointments
with his tradesmen, did you ever hear
of his forgetting to go to court when a place was to
be disposed of? Did he ever make a blunder, and
send a bribe to a man out of power? Did he ever
forget to kneel before the Prince of this Island&mdash;or
to look in his highness's presence like the statue
of Patient-resignation in humble expectation?&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Dear, Sir Luke<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Sent from his own country in his
very infancy, and brought up in the different
courts of petty, arbitrary Princes here in Asia;
he is the slave of every great man, and the tyrant
of every poor one.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> "Petty Princes!"&mdash;'tis well his highness
our Sultan does not hear you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> 'Tis well he does not&mdash;don't you
repeat what I say&mdash;but you know how all this fine
country is harrassed and laid waste by a set of
Princes, Sultans, as they style themselves, and I
know not what&mdash;who are for ever calling out to
each other "that's mine," and "that's mine;"&mdash;and
"you have no business here"&mdash;and "you have
no business there"&mdash;and "I have business every
where;" [<i>Strutting</i>] then "give <i>me</i> this,"&mdash;and
"give <i>me</i> that;" and "take this, and take that."</p>
<p class="right">[<i>makes signs of fighting.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> A very elegant description truly.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Why, you know 'tis all matter of
fact&mdash;and Lord Flint, brought up from his youth
amongst these people, has not one <i>trait</i> of an Englishman
about him&mdash;he has imbibed all this country's
cruelty, and I dare say wou'd mind no more
seeing me hung up by my thumbs&mdash;or made to
dance upon a red-hot gridiron<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> That is one of the tortures I never heard
of!&mdash;O! I shou'd like to see that of all things!</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Yes&mdash;by keeping this man's company,
you'll soon be as cruel as he is&mdash;he will
teach you every vice&mdash;a consequential&mdash;grave&mdash;dull&mdash;and
yet with that degree of levity, that
dares to pay his addresses to a woman, even before
her husband's face.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Did not you say, this minute, his Lordship
had not a <i>trait</i> of his own country about
him?&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Well, well&mdash;as you say, that last <i>is</i>
a <i>trait</i> of his own country.</p>

to <i>you</i>, if you will hold your tongue&mdash;Pray, my
Lord, are you engaged out to dinner to-day? for

<p><i>Lady.</i> We are going to<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> No&mdash;I think (now you put me in mind
of it) I think I have company to dine with me&mdash;I
am either going out to dinner, or have company
to dine with me; but I really can't tell which&mdash;however,
my people know<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but I can't call to

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Perhaps your Lordship <i>has</i> dined;
can you recollect that?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> No, no&mdash;I have not dined<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>what's
o'clock?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Perhaps, my Lord, you have not breakfasted.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> O, yes, I've breakfasted&mdash;I think so&mdash;but
upon my word these things are very hard to
remember.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> They are indeed, my Lord&mdash;and I
wish all my family wou'd entirely forget them.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> What did your Ladyship say was
o'clock?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Exactly twelve, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Bless me! I ought to have been some
where else then&mdash;an absolute engagement.&mdash;I have
broke my word&mdash;a positive appointment.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Shall I send a servant?</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> No, no, no, no&mdash;by no means&mdash;it can't
be helped now&mdash;and they know my unfortunate
failing&mdash;besides, I'll beg their pardon, and I trust
that will be ample satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> You are very good, my Lord, not to
leave us.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> I cou'd not think of leaving you so soon,
Madam&mdash;the happiness I enjoy here is <i>such</i>&mdash;</p>

come again.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> A Gentleman, Sir, just come from on
board an English vessel, says, he has letters to present
to you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Shew him in&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> Servant.] <i>He</i>

it <i>behind</i>, too, I suppose.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter Mr.</i> Twineall, <i>in a fashionable undress</i>.
 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Twi.</i> Sir Luke, I have the honour of presenting
to you, [<i>Gives letters</i>] one from my Lord
Cleland&mdash;one from Sir Thomas Shoestring&mdash;one
from Colonel Fril.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> [<i>Aside</i>] Who in the name of wonder
have my friends recommended?&mdash;[<i>reads while Lord</i>
Flint <i>and the Lady talk apart</i>] No&mdash;as I live, he is
a gentleman, and the son of a Lord&mdash;[<i>going to
Lady</i> Tremor.] My dear, that is a gentleman,
notwithstanding his appearance&mdash;don't laugh&mdash;but
let me introduce you to him.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> A gentleman! certainly&mdash;I did not look
at him before&mdash;but now I can perceive it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Mr. Twineall, give me leave to introduce
Lady Tremor to you, and my Lord Flint&mdash;this,
my Lord, is the Honourable Mr. Twineall
from England, who will do me the favour to remain
in my house, till he is settled to his mind in
some post here. [<i>They bow.</i>] I beg your pardon,
Sir, for the somewhat cool reception Lady Tremor
and I gave you at first&mdash;but I dare say her Ladyship
was under the same mistake as myself&mdash;and I must
own I took you at first sight for something very different
from the person you prove to be&mdash;for really
no English ships have arrived in this harbour for
these five years past, and the dress of us English
gentlemen is so much altered since that time&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> But, I hope, Sir Luke, if it is, the alteration
meets with your approbation.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> O! to be sure&mdash;it is extremely elegant
and becoming.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Yes, my dear, I don't doubt but you
think so; for I remember you used to make your
favourite monkey wear just such a jacket, when
he went out a visiting.</p>

<p><i>Twin.</i> Was he your favourite, Madam?&mdash;Sir,
you are very obliging. [<i>Bowing to Sir Luke.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> My Lord, if it were possible for your
Lordship to call to your <i>remembrance</i> such a trifle&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Dear Sir Luke<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="ex">[<i>Pulling&nbsp;him.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Egad, I believe I do call to my remembrance&mdash;[<i>Gravely

Sir, that I perceive any great resemblance&mdash;or, if
it was so&mdash;I dare say it is merely in the dress<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>which
I must own strikes me as most ridiculous&mdash;very
ridiculous indeed.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> My Lord!</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> I beg pardon, if I have said any thing
that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Lady Tremor, what did I say?<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>make
my apology, if I have said any thing improper&mdash;you
know my unhappy failing.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Goes up the stage.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>to Twineall.</i>] Sir, his Lordship has made
a mistake in the word "ridiculous," which I am
sure he did not mean to say&mdash;but he is apt to make
use of one word for another&mdash;his Lordship has
been so long out of England, that he may be said in
some measure to have forgotten his native language.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>His Lordship all this time appears consequentially absent.</i></p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> And you have perfectly explained, Madam&mdash;indeed
I ought to have been convinced,
without your explanation, that if his Lordship
made use of the word <i>ridiculous</i> (even intentionally)
that the word had now changed its former
sense, and was become a mode to express satisfaction&mdash;or
his Lordship wou'd not have made use
of it in the very forcible manner he did, to a perfect
stranger.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> What, Mr. Twineall, have you new
modes, new fashions for <i>words</i> too in England,
as well as for dresses?&mdash;and are you equally extravagant
in their adoption?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> I never heard, Sir Luke, but that the
fashion of words varied, as well as the fashion of
every thing else.</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> But what is most extraordinary&mdash;we have
now a fashion in England, of speaking without
any words at all.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Pray, Sir, how is that?</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Ay, do, Mr. Twineall, teach my
wife, and I shall be very much obliged to you&mdash;it
will be a great accomplishment. Even you, my
Lord, ought to be attentive to this fashion.</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> Why, Madam, for instance, when a gentleman
is asked a question which is either troublesome
or improper to answer, you don't say you
<i>won't</i> answer it, even though you speak to an inferior<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but
you say<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"really it appears to mee-e-e-e-e&mdash;
[<i>mutters and shrugs</i>]&mdash;that is&mdash;mo-mo-mo-mo-mo&mdash;[<i>mutters</i>]&mdash;if
you see the thing&mdash;for
my part<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>te-te-te-te<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>and that's all I can tell
about it at <i>present</i>."</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> And you have told nothing!</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> Nothing upon earth.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> But mayn't one guess what you mean?</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> O, yes&mdash;perfectly at liberty to guess.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Well, I'll be shot if I <i>could</i> guess.</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> And again&mdash;when an impertinent pedant
asks you a question that you know nothing about,
and it may not be convenient to say so&mdash;you answer
<i>boldly</i>, "why really, Sir, my opinion <i>is</i>, that the
Greek poet&mdash;he-he-he-he&mdash;[<i>mutters</i>]&mdash;we-we-we-we&mdash;you
see&mdash;if his idea was&mdash;and if the Latin

shou'd think&mdash;in my humble opinion&mdash;but the
Doctor <i>may</i> know better than I."<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> The Doctor must know very little
else.</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> Or in case of a duel, where one does not
care to say who was right, or who was wrong&mdash;you
answer&mdash;"<i>This</i>, Sir, is the state of the matter&mdash;Mr.

the other&mdash;in short&mdash;[<i>whispers</i>]&mdash;whis-whis-whis-whis"<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> "There, now you have it&mdash;there 'tis&mdash;but
don't say a word about it&mdash;or, if you do&mdash;don't
say it come from me."&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Why, you have not told a word of the
story!</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> But that your auditor must not say to you&mdash;that's
not the fashion&mdash;he never tells you that&mdash;he
may say&mdash;"You have not made yourself
<i>perfectly</i> clear;"&mdash;or he may say&mdash;"He must have
the matter <i>more particularly</i> pointed out somewhere
else;"&mdash;but that is all the auditor can say with
good breeding.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> A very pretty method indeed to satisfy
one's curiosity!</p>

inquiries concerning the state of this country.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Sir Luke starts, and fixes his eyes suspiciously

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Why, one does not like to speak

<i>you</i> may tell us what is going on there.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Pray, Mr. Haswell, is it true that the
Sultan cut off the head of one of his wives the
other day because she said "I won't?"</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Do, my dear, be silent.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> I won't.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> O, that the Sultan had you instead of
me!</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> And with my head off, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> No, my dear; in that state, I shou'd
have no objection to you myself.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Aside to Sir Luke.</i>] Now, I'll frighten
you ten times more.&mdash;But, Mr. Haswell, I am
told there are many persons suspected of disaffection
to the present Sultan, who have been lately,
by his orders, arrested, and sold to slavery, notwithstanding
there was no proof against them produced.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> Proof!<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>in a State such as this, the
charge is quite sufficient.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> [<i>In apparent agonies, wishing to turn

your Lordship find yourself this afternoon?&mdash;this
morning, I mean&mdash;Bless my soul! why I begin to

<p class="right">[<i>Smiling and fawning.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> [<i>Aside to Lady.</i>] Take care what you
say before that tool of state&mdash;look at him, and
tremble for your head.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Look at him, and tremble for <i>yours</i>&mdash;and
so, Mr. Haswell, all this is true?&mdash;and some
people, of consequence too, I am told, dragged
from their homes, and sent to slavery merely on
suspicion?</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> Yet, less do I pity those, than some, whom
prisons and dungeons crammed before, are yet
prepared to receive.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Mr. Haswell, such is the Sultan's pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Will your Lordship take a turn in
the garden? it looks from this door very pleasant;&mdash;does
not it?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> But pray, Mr. Haswell, has not the Sultan
sent for you to attend at his palace this morning?</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> He has, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> There! I heard he had, but Sir Luke
said not.&mdash;I am told he thinks himself under the
greatest obligations to you.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> The report has flattered me&mdash;but if his
highness <i>shou'd</i> think himself under obligations, I
can readily point a way, by which he may acquit
himself of them.</p>

myself undertake to praise the vices of a man of
sentiment till he shall think them so many virtues.&mdash;You

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Why, then Aurelia, (though I never mention'd

were improperly fixed upon a young gentleman
in that neighbourhood; and this was his reason

am in tears because I have not a husband, while
you see Lady Tremor every day in tears for the
very opposite cause?</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> No matter&mdash;women like a husband
through pride&mdash;and I have known a woman marry
from that very motive, even a man she has been
ashamed of.</p>

married from pride.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Yes;&mdash;and I'll let her know pride is

Grissel's threw a whole urn of boiling water upon
your legs, did I give any proofs of female weakness?
did I faint, scream, or even shed a tear?</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> No&mdash;no&mdash;very true&mdash;and while I lay
sprawling on the carpet, I could see you fanning
and holding the smelling bottle to the Lady of the
house, begging her not to make herself uneasy,
"for that the accident was of no manner of consequence."</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Dear Sir, don't be angry;&mdash;I am sure her
Ladyship spoke as she thought.</p>

might be easily recovered.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> No, indeed, I did not&mdash;but I thought
Sir Luke had frequently charged me with the
want of patience; and that moment, the very
thing in the world I cou'd have wished, happened&mdash;on
purpose to give me an opportunity to prove
his accusation false.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Very well, Madam&mdash;but did not the
whole company cry shame on your behaviour? did
not they say, it was not the conduct of a wife?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Only our particular acquaintance cou'd
say so&mdash;for the rest of the company, I am sure,
did not take me to be your wife&mdash;thank Heaven,
our appearances never betray that secret&mdash;do you
think we look like the same flesh and blood?</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> That day, in particular, we did not&mdash;for
I remember you had been no less than three
hours at your toilet.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> And, indeed, Sir Luke, if you were to
use milk of roses, and several other little things
of that kind, you can't think how much more
like a fine gentleman you wou'd look.&mdash;Such
things as those make, almost, all the difference
there is between you and such a gentleman as
Mr. Twineall.</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> No, pardon me, Madam&mdash;a face like

of <i>our</i> sex<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

this throne, is no impostor, (as the rebel party
wou'd insinuate) no low-born man, but of the

I verily believe that if a large scymitar was

sell herself to the prince of all these territories.

her love, snatch her from his expecting arms,
and bear her far away&mdash;where, in peaceful solitude
we lived, till, in the heat of the rebellion
against the late Sultan, I was forced from my
happy home to bear a part.&mdash;I chose the imputed
rebels side, and fought for the young aspirer.&mdash;An
arrow, in the midst of the engagement, pierced
his heart; and his officers, alarmed at the terror
this stroke of fate might cause amongst their
troops, urged me (as I bore his likeness) to counterfeit
it farther, and shew myself to the soldiers
as their king recovered. I yielded to their suit,
because it gave me ample power to avenge the
loss of my Arabella, who had been taken from
her home by the merciless foe, and barbarously
murdered.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> Murdered!</p>

<p><i>Sul.</i> I learnt so&mdash;and my fruitless search to find
her since has confirmed the intelligence.&mdash;Frantic
for her loss, I joyfully embraced a scheme which
promised vengeance on the enemy&mdash;it prospered,&mdash;and
I revenged my wrongs and her's, with such
unsparing justice on the foe, that even the men
who made me what I was, trembled to reveal their
imposition; and they find it still their interest to
continue it.</p>

wretches, that dare whisper I am not the real Sultan,

<p><i>Elv.</i> To avoid all suspicion of my real situation,
and to be sure to gain admittance, I put on this
habit, and told the servant, when I inquired for
you, I was just arrived from England&mdash;[<i>She starts.</i>]

was in this suspicious place, or I might plunge a
whole family in the imputed guilt of mine.</p>

no likelihood to gain admission&mdash;and what, what
wou'd I not have sacrificed, rather than left you
for ever without a last farewell? think on these
weighty causes, and pardon the deception.</p>

<br />
Haswell <i>and the female Prisoner discovered</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Haswell.</i> Rather remain in this loathsome prison!&mdash;refuse
the blessing offered you!&mdash;the blessing your
pleased fancy formed so precious you durst not
even trust its reality!</p>

<p><i>Pris.</i> No&mdash;while my pleased <i>fancy</i> only saw the
prospect, I own it was delightful; but now reason
beholds it within my reach, the view is
changed&mdash;and what, in the gay dream of fond delirium,
seemed a blessing, in my waking hours of
sad reflection would prove the most severe of punishments.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> Explain&mdash;what is the cause that makes
you think thus?</p>

<p><i>Pris.</i> A cause that has alone for fourteen years
made me resigned to a fate like this.&mdash;When you
first mentioned my release from this drear place,
my wild ideas included, with the light, all that had
ever made the light a blessing&mdash;'twas not the <i>sun</i>
I saw in my mad transport, but a lost husband
filled my roving fancy&mdash;'twas his idea that gave
the colours of the world their beauty, and made
me fondly hope to grasp its sweets.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> A husband!</p>

<p><i>Pris.</i> But the world that I was wont to enjoy
with him&mdash;to see again without him&mdash;every well-known
object would wound my mind with dear remembrances
for ever lost, and make my freedom
torture.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> But yet<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Pris.</i> Oh! on my knees a thousand times I have
thanked Heaven that <i>he</i> partook not of this dire
abode&mdash;that he shared not with me my hard usage!&mdash;a
greater blessing I possess'd from that, than all
his loved society cou'd have given&mdash;but in a
happy world, where smiling nature pours her
boundless gifts!&mdash;oh! there his loss wou'd be unsufferable.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> Do you lament him dead?</p>

<p><i>Pris.</i> Yes&mdash;or, like me, a prisoner&mdash;else he
wou'd have sought me out&mdash;have sought his Arabella!&mdash;[Haswell
<i>starts</i>.]&mdash;Why do you start?</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> Are you a Christian?&mdash;an European?</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> I am.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> The name made me suppose it.&mdash;I am
shocked that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>the Christian's sufferings&mdash;[<i>Trying
to conceal his surprise.</i>]&mdash;but were you made a
prisoner in the <i>present</i> Sultan's reign?</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Yes, or I had been set free on his ascent
to the throne; for he gave pardon to all the enemies
of the slain monarch: but I was taken in a
vessel, where I was hurried in the heat of the
battle with a party of the late Emperor's friends&mdash;and
all the prisoners were by the officers of the
present Sultan sent to slavery, or confined, as I
have been, in hopes of ransom from their friends.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> And did never intelligence or inquiry
reach you from your husband?</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Never.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> Never?</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> I once was informed of a large reward for
the discovery of a female Christian, and, with
boundless hopes, asked an interview with the messenger;
but found, on inquiry, <i>I</i> could not answer
his description, as he <i>secretly</i> informed me it
was the Sultan who made the search for one <i>he
himself</i> had known and dearly loved.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> Good Heaven!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;You then conclude
your husband dead?</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> I do;&mdash;or, like me, by some mischance,
taken with the other party, and having no friend
to plead his cause before the Emperor, whom he
served<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Has.</i> <i>I</i>'ll plead it&mdash;should I ever chance to find
him&mdash;but, ere we can hope for other kindness, you
must appear before the Sultan&mdash;thank him for
the favour which you now decline, and tell the
cause why you cannot accept it.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Alas! almost worn out with sorrow&mdash;an
object of affliction as I am&mdash;in pity, excuse me&mdash;present
my thanks&mdash;my humble gratitude&mdash;but
pardon my attendance.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> Nay, you must go&mdash;it is necessary&mdash;I
will accompany you to him.&mdash;Retire a moment;
but when I send, be ready.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> I shall obey.</p>

a poor place it is!&mdash;in short, Sir, my crime is
said to be an offence against the state; and they
tell me no friend on earth but you can get that remitted.</p>

are for so few persons&mdash;and those already

<p><i>Twi.</i> O, I know I am no favourite of yours&mdash;you

of use to my country nor of benefit to society.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> You mistake me, Sir&mdash;I think such glaring
imperfections as yours will not be of so
much disadvantage to society as those of a less-faulty
man.&mdash;In beholding your conduct, thousands
shall turn from the paths of folly, to which
fashion, custom, nature, (or call it what you will)
impels them;&mdash;therefore, Mr. Twineall, if not
pity for your faults, yet a concern for the good

your return to it.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> Well, Madam, and what have they to say?</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Who are we to tell our story to?&mdash;There
does not seem to be any one fitting in judgement.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> Tell it to me, Sir&mdash;I will report it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Why then, Mr. Haswell, as Ghosts
sometimes walk&mdash;and as one's conscience is sometimes
troublesome&mdash;I think Mr. Twineall has
done nothing to merit death, and the charge
which his Lordship sent in against him, we begin
to think too severe&mdash;but, if there was any false
statement<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> It was the fault of my not charging my
memory&mdash;any error I have been guilty of, must
be laid to the fault of my total want of memory.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> And what do you hope from this confession?</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> To remit the prisoner's punishment
of death to something less, if the Sultan will
please to annul the sentence.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Yes&mdash;and grant ten or twelve years imprisonment&mdash;or
the Gallies for fourteen years&mdash;or<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> Ay, ay, something in that way.</p>

<p><i>Has.</i> For shame&mdash;for shame&mdash;Gentlemen!&mdash;the
extreme rigour you shew in punishing a dissension
from your opinion, or a satire upon your
folly, proves to conviction, what reward you had
bestowed upon the <i>skilful</i> flatterer.</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> Gentlemen and Ladies, pray why wou'd
you wish me requited with such extreme severity,
merely for my humble endeavours to make myself
agreeable?&mdash;Lady Tremor, upon my honour
I was credibly informed, your ancestors were
Kings of Scotland.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Impossible!&mdash;you might as well say that
you heard Sir Luke had distinguished himself at
the battle of<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> And he <i>did</i> distinguish himself; for he
was the only one that ran away.</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> Cou'd it happen?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Yes, Sir, it did happen.</p>

<p><i>Sir Luke.</i> And go <i>you</i>, Mr. Twineall, into a
field of battle, and I think it is very likely to happen
again.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> If Mr. Haswell has obtained your pardon,
Sir, it is all very well&mdash;but let me advise
you to keep your sentiments on politics to yourself,
for the future&mdash;as you value that pretty head
of yours.</p>

<p><i>Twi.</i> I thank you, Sir&mdash;I do value it.</p>

plead, Sir Luke, for your interest with <ins title="original has Aureila's">Aurelia's</ins>

<p><i>Elv.</i> He <i>must</i> suffer them&mdash;there are virtues,
which praise cannot taint&mdash;such are Mr. Haswell's&mdash;for
they are the offspring of a mind, superior
even to the love of fame&mdash;neither can they,
through malice, suffer by applause, since they
are too sacred to incite envy, and must conciliate
the respect, the love, and the admiration of all.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
